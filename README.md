## Instructions
Once you've loaded the map, press `S` to begin moving.
*Note* I have a concurring bug that will not allow me to properly copy the path to the player when reloading the map. Please close the game and open and load a different map for testing. Apologies, spent 2 hours on the bug and I can't figure it out.
